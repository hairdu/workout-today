</center> <p><strong>Protein After Ab Workout</strong>, After a workout your body will need 10 grams of essential amino acids in one sitting to maximize your muscle building and repair, and it needs to be taken with carbs (about 1.5 g x your weight in kg) within 30 minutes after completing your workout. For example, in one 2013 study published in the journal of physiology, men performed resistance exercise and followed up their workout by consuming 80 grams of protein over the next 12 hours.</p>

<p>It has been shown that muscle protein synthetic rate (mps) is elevated in humans by 50% at 4 hrs following a bout of heavy resistance training, and by 109% at 24 hrs following training. Meaning you are metabolically active because of the increased muscle mass. This will depend on your size and your goals. When you consume protein, your body uses that to build and repair tissues, so it becomes not only important for muscle recovery but much more.</p>
<h3 id="a-250ml-serving-of-milk-and-chocolate-milk-contain-approximately-9g-of-protein">A 250ml serving of milk and chocolate milk contain approximately 9g of protein.</h3><p>Moreover, working out in a fasted state uses up all your glycogen and starts burning through your reserved fat and muscles if you end up spending too much out of your fat reserves. Immediately after your workout, ingest a liquid source of protein that contains complete proteins, such as whole milk or a protein shake. It’s an absolutely proven falsehood that you need to consume your whey protein within 30 minutes after your workout to maximize bioavailability and muscle uptake. This study further examined the time course for elevated muscle protein synthesis by examining its rate at 36 hrs following a training session. It has been shown that muscle protein synthetic rate (mps) is elevated in humans by 50% at 4 hrs following a bout of heavy resistance training, and by 109% at 24 hrs following training. Protein intake is a vital part of any diet, but when working out its importance increases.</p>
