<p>It’s every person’s favorite day in the gym… chest day. Many a chest workout has deservedly started with the bench press. For example, you could perform a decline dumbbell press, decline barbell press and decline fly… or a decline dumbbell press, decline dumbbell fly and decline cable fly. (the weights will move down and out as you lower them, as if they were outlining two edges of a triangle.)</p>
<h3 id="to-amplify-the-lower-fibers-of-your-pecs-youll-need-to-get-creative">To amplify the lower fibers of your pecs, you’ll need to get creative.</h3><p>On the exhale, use the chest muscles to push the dumbbells up. It’s every person’s favorite day in the gym… chest day. Add these exercises to the end of your normal chest workout to help give the lower chest a good workout. I like to do four to five sets and pyramid up on the weight each time during the decline dumbbell bench press. Squeeze your chest at the bottom and let it slowly stretch when you go back up (5 sets) (15 reps) (30 sec rest) 6. We will deal with the upper blocks.</p>
