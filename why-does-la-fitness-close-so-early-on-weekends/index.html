<p>So, on may 5, when la fitness tried to run my old card, it was declined. One thing to keep in mind is that not all amenities will stay open late, as the staff may shut down the pool area earlier and you may have difficult finding group classes past 8pm on the weekends. I know everyone would love at.</p>

<p>It operates all the 7 days in a week and only closes on their holiday hours, including christmas day, easter sunday, and thanksgiving day. In my experience, gold’s gym is better at maintaining. 8pm weekdays and 5pm weekends?? To cancel an la fitness membership, start by logging into your account on the la fitness website.

<p>La fitness opens at 5 am and will close at 10 pm on friday for most locations. La hours of fitness is the norm of all health clubs, with early opening hours and late closing hours on the week and shorter hours on weekends.

<p>Why do you guys close so early on the weekends? Does planet fitness have 24 hour access?

<p>Why do you guys close so early on the weekends? Peak hours are between 4:30 and 8. Depending on which gold’s gym you go to, a membership can cost $20 or more per month than la fitness, but the extra cost is worth it in my opinion. I love that smoothie king is right next door and if there�s overflow.</p>

<p>Peak hours are between 4:30 and 8. Weekends i find that after 4p is fairly crowd free. This makes them accessible to a wider demographic of consumers, including those with busier work schedules who only have limited hours to hit the gym. After a couple of days, call the la fitness. One thing to keep in mind is that not.</p>

<p>Yes, it remains open on saturdays and sundays. Mail the completed and signed form to this address: Of course, if you can go during the day that would be perfect, but if you decide to go at night it.
